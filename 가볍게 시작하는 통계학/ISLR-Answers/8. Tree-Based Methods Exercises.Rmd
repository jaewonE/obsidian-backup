  - When using boosting with depth=1, each model consists of a single split created using one distinct variable. So the total number of decision trees(B) is the same as the number of predictors(p); $B=p$ in this case. A new model is fit on the residuals left over from the previous model, and the new model's output is then added to the previous models. Therefore, the final model is additive.

  - $\hat{p}_{mk}$ : Proportion of training observations in the $m^{th}$ region from the $k^{th}$ class.
  - Therefore, in a setting with two classes (k=2), $\hat{p}_{m1} = 1-\hat{p}_{m2}$.
  
  - Classification Error Rate `E` when $1>\hat{p}_{m1}>0.5$(Class 1 is most common class): $E = 1-\hat{p}_{m1}$
  - `E` when $0<\hat{p}_{m1}<0.5$ (Class 1 is least common class): $E = 1-\hat{p}_{m2} = 1-(1-\hat{p}_{m1})$
  
  - Gini index (G) takes a small value when $\hat{p}_{mk}$ is near 0 or 1. 
  - Gini index in terms of $\hat{p}_{m1}$  is: $G = 2\hat{p}_{m1}(1-\hat{p}_{m1})$.
  
  - Cross entropy (D) is: $D = -\hat{p}_{m1}\log\hat{p}_{m1}-(1-\hat{p}_{m1})\log(1-\hat{p}_{m1})$.

__Majority voting for classification:__
  
  - Count of `P(Class is Red | X) < 0.5 = 4` and `P(Class is Red | X) >= 0.5 = 6`. So `X` is classified as red. 

__Average probability:__

  - Average probability that `P(Class is Red | X)` is `4.5/10 = 0.45`. Therefore, `X` is classified as green.

  The algorithm grows a very large tree $T_0$ using recursive binary splitting to minimise the RSS. It stops growing when a terminal node has has fewer than some minimum number of observations.$T_0$ due to its size and complexity can overfit the data. As such a tree 'pruning' process is applied to $T_0$ that returns subtrees as a function of $\alpha$ (a positive tuning parameter).Each value of $\alpha$ results in a tree $T$ that is a subset of $T_0$ which minimizes the quantity (8.4).
  
  Thereafter, K-fold cross-validation is used to select the best value of $\alpha$, by evaluating the predictions from trees on the test set. The value of $\alpha$ that gives the lowest test MSE is selected.
  
  Finally, the best value of $\alpha$ is used to prune `T`. This will return the tree corresponding to that $\alpha$.

  - The test error decreases rapidly as the number of trees increases.
  - The test error gets lower as m decreases from m=p upto m=p/3, and thereafter we find no significant changes.

  - Branch 8 results in a terminal node. The split criterion is `WeekofPurchase < 238.5` and there are 49 observations in this branch, with each observation belonging to MM. Therefore, the final prediction for this branch is `MM`.

  - The test MSE is high when lambda is very small, and it also rises as values of lambda gets bigger than 0.01. The minimum test MSE is __0.196__ at $\lambda=0.01$.
  - The train MSE decreases rapidly as $\lambda$ increases. The minimum training MSE is __8.8e-11__ when $\lambda=0.48$.

preds = rep("No",4822)
preds[probs.Caravan>0.20]="Yes"

# Confusion matrix
actual = test.set$Purchase
table(actual, preds)
```

  - Overall, the boosted model makes correct predictions for 92.2% of the observations. 
  
  - The actual number of "No" is 94% and "Yes" is 6%, and so this is an imbalanced dataset. A model simply predicting "No" on each occasion would have made 94% of the predictions correctly. However, in this case we are more interested in predicting those who go on to purchase the insurance.
  
  - The model predicts "Yes" 158 times, and it is correct on 35 of these predictions - so __22.2%__ of those predicted to purchase actually do so. This is much better than random guessing (6%).
  

__Comparing results with Logistic Regression__

```{r}
glm.fit = glm(Purchase~.-Purchase01, data = train.set, family = binomial)
glm.probs = predict(glm.fit, test.set, type="response")
glm.preds = rep("No",4822)
glm.preds[glm.probs>0.2]="Yes"
table(actual,glm.preds)
```

  - Logistic regression predicts "Yes" 408 times, and it is correct on 58 occasions - so __14.2%__ of those predicted to purchase actually do so. This model is better than random guessing but is worse than the boosted model.
