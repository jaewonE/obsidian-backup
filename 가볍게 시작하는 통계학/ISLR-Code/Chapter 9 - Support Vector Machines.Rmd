This lab primarily focuses on creating creating and tweaking a variety 
of Support Vector Classifiers using the `e1071` library. The text mentions the
availability of the `LiblineaR` library for very large linear problems, but 
we do not use it in this lab. We conclude the lab with a discussion/implementation
of ROC curves using the `ROCR` library. The topics that will be covered in this
lab include:

* Support Vector Classifiers

* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

* ROC Curves

* SVMs with K > 2 Classes

## 9.6.1: Support Vector Classifier

We begin the lab by building up a support vector classifier with the `svm()` function.
Recall that this classifier works by defining a linear decision boundary to separate
the two classes. With this in mind, we need to make sure that we set the `kernel`
option in `svm()` to "linear"

```{r Create toy data}
# Set up toy data to work with
set.seed(1)
dat <- tibble(
  x1 = rnorm(500),
  x2 = rnorm(500),
  y = factor(c(rep('A',250), (rep('B',250))))
)

# Add a little of separability between the classes
dat$x1[dat$y == "A"] <-  dat$x1[dat$y == "A"] + 5

# Check to see if classes are linearly separable
ggplot(dat, aes(x1, x2, col = y)) + 
  geom_jitter()

```


Now that we've created our toy data and can clearly see they are not linearly 
separable, let's fit the support vector classifier. Note that we need to make
sure that `y` is encoded as a factor variable in our formula. We set the `cost`
argument to 10 in this example as well. (Default is 1)

```{r SVC}
svc <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = 'linear',
           cost = 10, scale = FALSE)
plot(svc, dat)

summary(svc)
```


Our support vector classifier works pretty well (as it should, the data was made
to be very easily separated). Upon closer inspection, we can see that there are 
10 support vectors, 5 from each class. You'll notice that these 10 support vectors
are plotted as crosses on the above graph, and everything is left as an open circle

What should we expect to see if we set a smaller cost parameter? With a smaller
cost paramater our decision boundary gets a little more rigid and will allow
for fewer errors in the training set. In short - smaller margins, fewer support vectors

```{r SVC with smaller cost}
svc2 <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = 'linear',
            cost = 1, scale = FALSE)

summary(svc2)
```


How can we determine the best cost parameter to use? You should know by now that 
cross-validation is pretty much the answer to every parameter-tuning problem. Luckily,
the `e1071` library contains the `tune()` function, which will allow us to perform
10-fold cross-validation over a range of cost parameters.

```{r SVC with CV}
svc_cv <- tune(svm,y ~., data = dat, kernel = 'linear',
                   ranges = list(cost = c(.001, .01, .1, 1, 5, 10, 100)))

```

`tune()` returns an object of class `tune`, which contains results from the 10-fold CV,
including the best performing parameter values and their respective errors (`best.parameters`,
`best.performance`), a data frame of all parameter combinations and their corresponding results
(`performances`)

We'll take a glance at these components and check the results of our best-performing
cross-validated model

```{r svc_cv results}
summary(svc_cv)

best <-  svc_cv$best.model
summary(best)
```

Now that we have a working model, let's generate some test data (which should've been
done beforehand but is fine for instructional purposes). Keep in mind that we're
making our own data to have a pretty well-defined class boundary, so our test
error should be practically nil (and it is, as you'll see)

```{r test data/predictions}
# Change the seed so we don't get the exact same data
set.seed(2)
test <- tibble(
  x1 = rnorm(500),
  x2 = rnorm(500),
  y = factor(c(rep('A',250), (rep('B',250))))
)

# Add the same amount of separability between the classes
test$x1[test$y == "A"] <-  test$x1[test$y == "A"] + 5

# Make predictions
predictions <- predict(best, test)
table(predictions, truth = test$y)

```

## 9.6.2 Support Vector Machines
 
This section is mostly going to be an extension of the previous one, only now we
are learning how to use different kernels. In particular, we will do one example
with a radial kernel and another with a polynomial kernel. We begin by creating 
sample data


```{r sample data}
# Set up toy data to work with
set.seed(1)
dat <- tibble(
  x1 = rnorm(500),
  x2 = rnorm(500),
  y = factor(c(rep('A',250), (rep('B',250))))
)

# Add a little of separability between the classes
dat$x1[dat$y == "A"] <-  dat$x1[dat$y == "A"] + 3

```


We now fit the SVM using the `kernel = 'radial'` argument and setting the
gamma parameter to one
```{r radial kernel}
train <- dat %>%
  sample_frac(.5)

test <-  setdiff(dat, train)

rad_kern <-  svm(y ~ ., data = train, kernel = 'radial', gamma = 1, cost = 1)
plot(rad_kern, train)

```


Instead of spending too much time on this preliminary result, let's just continue
on by doing some cross-validation to determine the best gamma and cost parameter
values. Then, we can check how well those parameter values perform on the training
set.


```{r radial cv}
rad_cv <-  tune(svm, y ~ ., data = train, kernel = 'radial',
                ranges = list(cost = c(.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),
                              gamma = c(.5, 1, 2, 3, 4)))

summary(rad_cv)

table(prediction = predict(rad_cv$best.model),
      actual = train$y)

```

We'll just quickly run the same analysis with a polynomial kernel so we can compare
the results

```{r poly kernel}

poly_cv <-  tune(svm, y ~ ., data = train, kernel = 'polynomial',
                 ranges = list(cost = c(.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000),
                               degree = c(2, 3, 4)))

table(prediction = predict(poly_cv$best.model),
      actual = train$y)
```

***

## 9.6.3 ROC Curves

In order to produce ROC curves from SVM fits, we need to extract the fitted 
decision values by setting `decision.values = T` in `svm()`. Once we have that,
we use the `ROCR` library to help us build the curves.

For this example, we create the ROC curves using the training data because it is
slightly less effort


```{r}
# Run first SVM and observe ROC performance
svm_roc <-  svm(y ~ ., data = train, kernel= 'radial',
                gamma = 2, cost = 1, decision.values = T)
fitted <-  svm_roc$decision.values

perform <-  prediction(fitted, train$y) %>%
  performance(., 'tpr', 'fpr')

original <-  tibble(x = unlist(perform@x.values),
              y = unlist(perform@y.values))

ggplot(original, aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_line()



# Rerun svm with more liberal gamma values
svm_roc2 <-  svm(y ~ ., data = train, kernel= 'radial',
                gamma = 50, cost = 1, decision.values = T)
fitted2 <-  svm_roc2$decision.values

perform2 <-  prediction(fitted2, train$y) %>%
  performance(., 'tpr', 'fpr')

high_gamma <-  tibble(x = unlist(perform2@x.values),
              y = unlist(perform2@y.values))

# Graphically compare the two models
bind_rows("original" = original, "adjusted gamma" = high_gamma, .id = "Model") %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x, y, col = Model)) + 
  geom_line()

```

***

## 9.6.4 SVM with K > 2 Classes

When our dependent variable is categorical with more than two classes,
`svm()` will perform classification using the one-versus-one approach. Recall
that this requires ${K} \choose {2}$ SVMs for each possible comparison, so it might
be kind of slow.

```{r SVM Multiclassification}
# Create sample data
set.seed(1)
dat <- tibble(
  x1 = rnorm(600),
  x2 = rnorm(600),
  y = factor(c(rep('A', 200), (rep('B', 200)), rep('C', 200)))
)

# Artificially add separability between the classes
dat$x1[dat$y == "A"] <- dat$x1[dat$y == "A"] + 5
dat$x1[dat$y == "B"] <- dat$x1[dat$y == "B"] - 5

# Fit the SVM
multi_class <-  svm(y ~., data = dat, kernel = 'radial', cost = 10, gamma = 1)
plot(multi_class, dat)
```
